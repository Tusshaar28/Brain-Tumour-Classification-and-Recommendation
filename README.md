# Brain Tumour Classification and Recommendation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for brain tumor classification and recommendation. Using deep learning techniques and a recommendation engine, the system classifies brain tumor types and provides relevant treatment recommendations. The project integrates various technologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification and advanced APIs for recommendations.

## Features

- **Brain Tumour Classification**: Classifies brain tumors into predefined categories using a CNN model trained on medical imaging data.
- **Recommendation System**: Provides treatment recommendations based on the classified tumor type using LLAMA3 and GROQ APIs.
- **Web Application**: Implements a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for interacting with the classification and recommendation system.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:
- `tensorflow` or `keras` for deep learning models
- `requests` for API interactions
- `streamlit` for the web application
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling
- `scikit-learn` for additional machine learning tools

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow requests streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
